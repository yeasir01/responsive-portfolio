                    <p> My name is Yeasir Hugais and I am an entrepreneur 
                        and an ASE certified service consultant. After opening and operating two auto 
                        repair shops for several years, I made the decision to transition over to 
                        the retail industry, where I currently own and operate several gas stations 
                        across the Bay Area and Sac-Sierra regions. Technology has always been an 
                        integral part of my life and has served as a personal passion of mine. As 
                        a child, I would always take things apart and attempt to put them back together 
                        (sometimes unsuccessfully) - in order to better understand the technology, 
                        architecture and engineering behind the product. Those experiences fueled my 
                        interest in computer hardware and software. Throughout my teenager and early 
                        adult years, I became more proficient in knowing how to build, customize and 
                        repair computers and laptops. As I have progressed in my professional life, 
                        I have adapted those skills to other technologies, which I now use to grow 
                        and scale my businesses. I am now focusing on learning code, so that I may 
                        use those skills to develop custom software and applications that could be used 
                        for my current and future business opportunities.
