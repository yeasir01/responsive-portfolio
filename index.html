        <p>Welcome to my site. My name is Yeasir Hugais and I am an entrepreneur 
            and an ASE certified service consultant. After opening and operating two auto 
            repair shops for several years, I made the decision to transition over to 
            the retail industry, where I currently own and operate several gas stations 
            across the Bay Area and Sac-Sierra regions. Technology has always been an 
            integral part of my life and has served as a personal passion of mine. As 
            a child, I would always take things apart and attempt to put them back together 
            (sometimes unsuccessfully) - in order to better understand the technology, 
            architecture and engineering behind the product. Those experiences fueled my 
            interest in computer hardware and software. Throughout my teenager and early 
            adult years, I became more proficient in knowing how to build, customize and 
            repair computers and laptops. As I have progressed in my professional life, 
            I have adapted those skills to other technologies, which I now use to grow 
            and scale my businesses. I am now focusing on learning code, so that I may 
            use those skills to develop custom software and applications that could be used 
            for my current and future business opportunities.</p>
